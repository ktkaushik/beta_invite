## Setup

### Initializer

The `beta_invite` gem has a beta_invite installer. First step to setup is to run the __install generator__ 

```ruby
rails g beta_invite:install
```

This would create an __initializer__ named `beta_invite.rb`

### Migrations
The setup is very primary as of now. Once installed, you will need to copy the migrations by running this command

```ruby
rake beta_invite:install:migrations
```

Run the migrations

```ruby
rake db:migrate
```

The above migrations would create a `beta_invites` table in your app

###Mount
Now mount the `BetaInvite` engine by going into your `routes.rb` file and adding the below line

```ruby
mount BetaInvite::Engine, at: '/'
```

## Where are the invites ?

Well, you can fire up your rails console and you will see that all the tables are under `BetaInvite::BetaInvite`

This should fetch you all the records

```ruby
BetaInvite::BetaInvite.all
```

##Views

You can generate the views that the gem has into your rails app by this below command

```ruby
rails generate beta_invite:views
```

You may wanna upgrade your gem at this point in time

```ruby
gem update beta_invite
```

Obviously, you can mount it to any route.

__You may wanna restart your server__
